## About 
ParkPark is a Flutter-based mobile application targeted at people who frequent public parks and gardens for exercise and leisure activities. The application will ease their retrieval of various information such as weather and car-park availability. There will be no need to make multiple searches across platforms. 
  
The application is targeted at people with packed schedules who wish to increase their time spent in parks. For those who spend their busy day working in multiple locations, the application will provide information about parks in localities that may not be familiar to them. 

ParkPark is a newly developed, self-contained product developed using the Flutter framework. It uses geolocator service, car park information API service, Google Maps API service and weather information API service. With these, ParkPark will be able to provide the location of the parks together with weather and cark park information, thereby helping users to make informed decisions. 

**Major Functions of ParkPark:** 
1. Display list of parks 
2. Search for parks 
3. Display weather information 
4. Display car park information 
5. Recommend parks to users
